### Hey, how's it going?

My name's Tyler, and I'm a [programmer](https://github.com/t-schreibs) and [musician](https://scribble-t.bandcamp.com) based out of Portland, Oregon. I'm the lead guitarist for [Combobox](https://www.combobox.band), and I've been cooking up an interesting audio-visual solo project in my free time. Some of my work over the last year:

I believe in open source, and am a member of a number of music software & hardware communities. A couple recent projects:

[PIOClock: A simple square wave clock for the Raspberry Pi Pico](https://github.com/t-schreibs/PIOClock)

[Poly Square: A polyphonic square oscillator with detuning for the EuroPi](https://github.com/t-schreibs/EuroPi/blob/main/software/contrib/poly_square.py)

[Send me an email](mailto:tylereschreiber@gmail.com) if you'd like to discuss project proposals & performance opportunities, or else if you'd just like to say hi!
